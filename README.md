This project focuses on solving the Tower of Hanoi problem and using the computation times to analyse exponential computation. 
Tower_of_Hanoi.py solves the TOH problem under 0 constraints.
Time_TOH.py times TOH.py for every inetegral value of N (number of discs) and plots the data. 

The data collected using Time_TOH.py was fed into function fitting programmes (https://wwww.mycurvefit) to generate an approximate function for the computation time for integral values of N. 
The functions collcted, listed below were used to estimate times for higher values of N (values for which my computer is too slow and I am too impatient).
